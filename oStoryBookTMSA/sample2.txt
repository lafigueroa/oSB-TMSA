(CNN)A small Missouri town's discovery that a gunman killed seven people and injured another Thursday night began when a girl managed to flee a residence where she heard gunfire.

She ran to a neighbor's house and called police, say investigators in Tyrone, Missouri.

Authorities then found a trail of death that was so staggering, a state trooper lost count at a news conference.

Seven people, all gunshot victims, were found dead in four residences in the small town. One person managed to survive, and he was found wounded in one of the homes.

The gunman also was found dead after going to another county and apparently shooting himself there. He was identified Friday as Joseph Jesse Aldridge, 36, who was believed to be a cousin to four of the seven slain victims, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said.

And, in a twist to their probe, investigators happened upon another body -- that of an elderly woman -- in a fifth home, though it appears that she died of natural causes, authorities said.
